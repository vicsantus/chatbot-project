# Chatbot Lexart! üòä

## ü§î Contextualizing

The project is a simple chatbot, made in React, React Native and Context Api. It saves the entire conversation when exiting asking the user to download the conversation in csv.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention
When using the application. The bot will ask for the application's username and password. User username is `lexart` and password is `lexart123`.
It will not be possible to use the entire application without entering the username and password correctly when asked.

## ü§ñ How the project works

When starting the project you have 5 options to chat with the bot.
- "Hello", "I want" or "Good" - With one of these commands you start the bot, and it asks you for username and password.
- "Goodbye" - With this command you end the bot, and download the conversation in csv.
- When writing anything, the bot informs you that it did not understand what you said.
